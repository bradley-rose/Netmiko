# Netmiko
Netmiko examples with various devices for various functions

This repository will be a home base for various files built for working with Netmiko. In my travels, I've come across end-of-life Cisco ASA devices, and I've come across some fancy new devices that have API support. Obviously this isn't necessary for devices that have API support; but, for those that don't (simply, at least -- ASA, I'm looking at you), these can be utilized for various tasks.

To start with, I've just got some show commands, and I'm not sure how much further I'll expand. Netmiko has excellent documentation thanks to the creator, Kirk Byers, so go read up on Netmiko as a whole to see how you can take this code and mould it to your use cases.

Most importantly, have fun, and enjoy the DevNetOps journey. :)
